The Bioinformatics research group at MCRI focuses on statistical bioinformatics and computational biology. We work on analysis methods for high-throughput sequencing and microarrays and we are involved in many collaborative projects. 

Our research focuses include:
* Analysis of RNA-seq data
* Epigenetic analysis including: 
    * DNA methylation microarrays
    * ChIP-seq analysis
* Detecting disease causing variants in the human genome using high-throughput sequencing technologies.
