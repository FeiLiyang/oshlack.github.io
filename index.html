The bioinformatics research group at MCRI uses computational and statistical techniques to analyse and explore the transcriptome and genome. The group has a diverse and complementary skill set that includes statistics, computer science, genetics, software engineering, molecular biology and physics. We work on a range of projects from developing basic data analysis tools and statistical methods through to collaborative analysis of biological systems. We have major applications in cancer, kidney development and rare disease genomics.

Our current major projects focus on:
<ul>
    <li>Methods and analysis of single-cell RNA sequencing</li>
    <li>Transcriptomic analysis in non-model organisms and cancer</li>
    <li>Finding hidden and complex diagnostic variants in rare disease genomes</li>
</ul>
