* [bpipe](http://docs.bpipe.org/) - A tool for running and managing bioinformatics pipelines
* [JAFFA](https://github.com/Oshlack/JAFFA/wiki) - JAFFA is a multi-step pipeline that takes either raw RNA-Seq reads, or pre-assembled transcripts, then searches for gene fusions.
* [Corset](https://github.com/Oshlack/Corset/wiki) - Corset is a command-line software program to go from a de novo transcriptome assembly to gene-level counts.
* [missMethyl](http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/missMethyl.html) - Analysing Illumina HumanMethylation BeadChip Data
* [Lace](https://github.com/Oshlack/Lace/wiki) - From a group of transcripts, de novo contigs, reference sequence, long reads (or a mixture of all the above) construct a single linear representation of the transcriptome, a SuperTranscript, containing all the bases from all sequences whilst preserving the ordering in which they come in the trancsripts.
